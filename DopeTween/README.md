## FAQ:

 1. Why should I use DopeTween in my project?
	- DopeTween is an All-in-one Tweening unit for Unity Visual Scripting. With different types of Easing Types to choose from.

 2. Why isn't the unit showing up in the Fuzzy Finder?
	- Make sure you have Unity Visual Scripting installed in your Project (Currently only supported on Unity 2021.)
	- Project Settings > Visual Scripting > Regerate Units.

	- If you've tried both but still can't get it working then let us know on the Bolt Discord channel linked below.

 3. How do I use it?
	- In the FuzzyFinder type in "DopeTween" and add the unit to your Graph (Macro). 
	- It's a good idea to cache (Set) the Curves you need as Variables in a Start Method and call (Get) the Variable later on in your project.
	- Please refer the Demo scene for use cases.

 4. Which SuperUnits are included? What do they do?
	- **The SuperUnits included are as follows:**

		- **SU_RangeMapper_Float** - Clamps an incoming float value between a Pair of Values and Outputs them to a Value between another Pair of Values.
		- **SU_RangeMapper_Vector3** - Clamps an incoming Vector3 value between a Pair of Values and Outputs them to a Value between another Pair of Values.
		- **SU_RangeMapper_Generic** - Clamps an incoming value between a Pair of Values and Outputs them to a Value between another Pair of Values. (Generic version of RangeMapper Super Unit)

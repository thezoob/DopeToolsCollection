## FAQ:

 1. Why should I use DopeTween in my project?
	- DopeTween is an All-in-one Tweening unit for Bolt. With different types of Easing values to choose from.

 2. Why isn't the unit showing up in the Fuzzy Finder?
	- Make sure you have Bolt installed in your Project.
	- Make sure you 'Build Unit Options...' from the Tools>Bolt menu.
	- If you've tried both but still can't get it working then let us know on the Bolt Discord channel linked below.

 3. What is an AnimationCurve?
	- An AnimationCurve stores a collection of Keyframes that can be evaluated over time. 

 4. How do I use it?
	- In the FuzzyFinder type in "DopeCurves" and add the unit to your Graph (Macro). 
	- It's a good idea to cache (Set) the Curves you need as Variables in a Start Method and call (Get) the Variable later on in your project.
	- Please refer the Demo scene for use cases.



 5. Which SuperUnits are included? What do they do?
	- **The SuperUnits included are as follows:**

		- **SU_RangeMapper_Float** - Clamps an incoming float value between a Pair of Values and Outputs them to a Value between another Pair of Values.
